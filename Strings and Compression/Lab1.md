### Lab 1

#### Task 1 - Disemvoweling

Write a function in Java or JavaScript that removes all the vowels from a String.

#### Task 2 - Simple compression

Given a string that looks like **aaaabbbbbhhhhhttttttrrrrrr**, write a program that compresses the string by indicating how many sequential occurrences of a letter there are in a row. E.g.:
